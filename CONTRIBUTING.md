When submitting a pull request please clearly document what your pull request is fixing or adding. If it's adding something new please describe why and how it benifits the project. 

This is ment to be a starting point for anyone wanting to build electron applications using react and webpack. We want to keep all packages up to date as new versions come out. we also want to keep the project as low level as possible to be the best fit for every new electron react project. Only adding in packages that would be most commonly used in every project. 

Test your code for any vulnerabilities. Check that all packages included are secure and up to date. If your pull request is adding a new or updated package that is not secure or has vulnerabilities of any type (this includes security warnings) your pull request will be rejected.

Hackaish code will be rejected. All pull requsts should be considered long term repairs with good clean syntax.
