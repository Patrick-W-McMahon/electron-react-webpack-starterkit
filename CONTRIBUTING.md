This is ment to be a starting point for anyone wanting to build electron applications using react and webpack. We want to keep all packages up to date as new versions come out. we also want to keep the project as low level as possible to be the best fit for every new electron react project. Only adding in packages that would be most commonly used in every project. 

Test your code for any vulnerabilities. Check that all packages included are secure and up to date.
